# Codecademy Learners Analysis

## Overview
This project involves analyzing mockup Codecademy learners data using SQL. The dataset consists of two tables: `users` and `progress`. The project aims to gain insights into the learners' demographics, courses preferences, and usage of the mobile app.

## Project Goals
- Utilize SQL queries to analyze the data.
- Explore the data distribution, including top schools, learner demographics, and mobile app usage.
- Perform joins to gain insights into course preferences among different demographics.

## Setup Instructions
- If you choose to work on your computer, download the necessary files.
- Install SQLite and DB Browser if not already installed.
- Open the database file using DB Browser or run SQL commands from the terminal.

## Tasks
1. **Get to Know the Data:**
   - Identify the top 25 schools with .edu domains.
   - Count the number of .edu learners located in New York.
   - Determine the number of learners using the mobile app.

2. **Query Sign Up Counts for Each Hour:**
   - Use the `strftime()` function to query sign up counts for each hour.

3. **Explore the Data with Joins:**
   - Investigate whether different schools (.edu domains) prefer different courses.
   - Analyze courses taken by learners in New York and Chicago.

## Files
- `users` table: Contains user information including user_id, email_domain, country, etc.
- `progress` table: Includes user progress data for different courses.

## Usage
- Clone the repository.
- Open the README.md file to understand the project objectives and tasks.
- Execute the provided SQL queries using your preferred SQLite tool.

## Acknowledgments
- This project is inspired by Codecademy's SQL courses.
- Thanks to Codecademy for providing the mockup data and project requirements.
